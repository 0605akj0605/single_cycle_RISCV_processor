This is a 32 bit ALU hardware implementation of 32-bit RISC V CPU.


I am currently working on implementing the below architecture.

## Instructions Executed (In Order)

```assembly
lw x6, -4(x9)   # Load word from memory at address (x9 - 4) into x6

sw x6, 8(x9)    # Store word from x6 into memory at address (x9 + 8)

or x4, x5, x6   # Bitwise OR: x4 = x5 | x6



```
All registers in data_memory and register file are initialized as:
register[i] = i  # Example: reg[1] = 1, reg[2] = 2, ..., reg[31] = 31

## Implementation Progress  

- âœ… **Completed:**  
  - Support for **I-type** instructions ( lw )
  - Support for **S-type** instructions ( sw )
  - Support for **R-type** instructions ( or )

- ðŸ”§ **Ongoing:**  
  - Support for  **R-type** instructions( beq )

- ðŸš€ **To be Added:**  
  - Booth's algorithm for multiplication.
  - Carry look ahead adder for addition.
